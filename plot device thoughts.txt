no 3d tho
skew is nice
text path is nice - get the outline of a text and then manipulate points - 	
	the spider example
stars and polygons are nice
similar rotations and transforms
random from a list is easy
all the examples are similar - random positioning and overlapping
decent grid and coordinate systems
random skew is neat
really efficient to choose from a list either variables or functions
can talk to xml pretty easy!
